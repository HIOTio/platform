## HIOT Platform

This is the repo for the backend (REST) services.

Modify config.js to point to a local/remote MongoDB deployment - or install the community edition of Mongo DB locally and just leave config.js as-is

enter the platform directory and run "npm install" to install dependencies, then just "node index.js" to run start the web services and sockets.

we'll add docs shortly to help you find your way around...
